# Week-13 Cluster Assignment

## Notes

For test 4-15 You will need to recompile your **MaxTemperature** driver class and JAR to modify the following: ```job.setNumReduceTasks(X)``` and set ``` job.setJobName("Max temperature");``` to include your initials:  ```job.setJobName("MT test 1 jrh");```

For test 4-6 You will need modify your MaxTemperature code to account for bad records use the sample code on P.174 of textbook *section 6-12* to include a counter that will output the number of bad records at the end of the job -- place this new code and jar file in  Week-13 -> badrecord folder (include just 1 sample)

Test 17 

For MaxTemperature*.java recompile ```mt.jar``` changing ```job.setJobName``` name to add your initials 
For Test 1-3:

* ~~A-E 1999 and small/1999 small/91-1000~~
* ~~F-N 1991 and small/1991 small/94-1000~~
* ~~O-Z 1994 and small/1994 small/99-1000~~
  + ~~Use ```/user/ncdc/small/80-1000```, ```/user/ncdc/small/90-1000```, ```/user/ncdc/small/80-90-1000``` as directed.~~

For each bullet point in a Test you will run it using these datasets:  /user/ncdc/199X/199X.txt* and /user/ncdc/small/9X-1000/* datasets 

*  199X.txt
*  199X.txt.bz2
*  199X.txt.gz
*  ~~9X-1000 small files (these are the induvidual 4K files not combined to a single file)~~

##  Test 1

* Without combiner, without intermediate compression, and 1 reducers
* Without combiner, without intermediate compression, and 2 reducers

## Test 16

* Using the datasets contained in ```/user/logs/large-logs``` write and compile a MapReduce Program to do the following: For each month in the year find the page (html or php) name that has the highest number of HTTP 200 responses that is not the index.* page as well as the number (count) of those results graphed together.  Use the following years and files:
    + Lastname A-E 2012 + 2013
    + Lastname F-N 2014 + 2015
    + Lastname O-Z 2016 + 2012   
    + ```web-server-logs.txt```
    + ```web-server-logs.bz2``` 
    + ```web-server-logs.gz```
*  Graph the retrieved data, based on results of previous 15 tests, you decide the single configuration that is optimum for achieving the results and explain why you chose that configuration for this test.  Include your code inside your Github account in a folder named test-16.  Make sure all coded needed to compile and run the job is present.  Add a ReadMe.md with any instructions or assumptions in that folder.

## Conclusion (test 17)

Write your general conclusion and recommendation for the optimal performance characteristics relating to **intermediate compression**, **compression**, **combiners**, **block size**, and **number of reducers** based on this work load and dataset results (reference your test results above).
